def demosaic_ximea_5x5(image_path, sort_bands=True):
    """
    Demosaics a Ximea multispectral NIR camera image with a repeating 
    5x5 mosaic pattern. This image starts in the top left corner at 
    x = 0, y = 3 and ends at x = 2044, y = 1082. The cropped image is 
    2045 x 1080. This image is assumed to be in RAW8 format.

    The spectral bands correspond to the following bandwidths for each mosaic offset:
    
        Row 0: 886, 896, 877, 867, 951
        Row 1: 793, 806, 782, 769, 675
